      <p>Hello, there! My name is Paolo Yap. I graduated from UC Merced in 2018, and worked as a mechanical engineer in San Francisco. Unfortunately, COVID-19 happened and I was laid off. However, I found a new passion in coding during this time and decided to learn as much as I can about it through the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp! It would be a great skill to add to my skillset, and I hope to maybe start a career in coding after finishing the bootcamp.</p>
